% Description: Loads .mat files that contain particle sizes at each outlet
%       and uses those counts for various statistical analysis and figure
%       production - individual experiment results

% Obtains efficiency and std for desired bin range size - a size of 5 Âµm was used
% for this analysis

% [effAvg,effSTD,binRange] = binRangeSize(in,o1,o2,low size,binSize,hi Size,N,flow,lobeName);
[effAvg,effStd,binRange] = binRangeSize(inlet_circ,o1,o2,10,5,30,N,flow,lobeName);

% Save for later plotting for all N = 3 experiments
save([expName,'.mat'],'binRange','effAvg','effStd','flow');

% Efficiencies were then plotted as mean +/- standard deviation 
% Data was used to compare Range and Simulation data
